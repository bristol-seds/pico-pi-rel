# pico-pi

This repository contains the source and hardware for a High Altitude
Balloon (HAB) tracker based around a
[Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/). The
Pi Zero V1.3 includes a camera connector, so we can use a
[Sony IMX219 camera](https://uk.farnell.com/raspberry-pi/rpi-8mp-camera-board/raspberry-pi-camera-board-v2/dp/2510728)
to return live images.

This design is optimised for weight-constrained payloads that use
solar panels for power. If you're new to HAB or using a Latex weather
balloon, then check out the awesome
[Pi in the Sky](http://www.pi-in-the-sky.com) project!
